In this exercise visitor can see the list of cocktail as he/she types the cocktail name in the search bar. Also visitor can see the detail of a cocktail by clicking the see detail button.You can see demo of the application [here](https://priceless-mestorf-d69af3.netlify.app/).

I have used cocktaildb API to fetch the data. And to manage the state of the application I have used react Hooks. Purpose of the this application was to learn more about react after completing basics of react.
